While reading Modular Programming in Java 9...

- It is most likely that the reason why I was getting...

Package packt.addressbook.util in both module packt.sortutil and module packt.addressbook

was because I literally has packt.addressbook.util in both
packt.sortutil and packt.addressbook modules...

As of now, I don't really know how to generate this error again,
I am pretty sure the previous command I used threw in a file I didn't
wanted in side the out directory.
