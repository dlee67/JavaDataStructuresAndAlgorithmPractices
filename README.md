Much prac, such determination, wow

I take no credits for any of the code being provided in this repository, for
handful of the programs here are not written by me. If one happens to stumble
upon the code of theirs in this repository, I'd be happy to credit the owner,
edit it, or get rid of it from this repository.

While reading Modular Programming in Java 9...

- It is most likely that the reason why I was getting...

Package packt.addressbook.util in both module packt.sortutil and module packt.addressbook

was because I literally has packt.addressbook.util in both
packt.sortutil and packt.addressbook modules...

As of now, I don't really know how to generate this error again,
I am pretty sure the previous command I used threw in a file I didn't
wanted in side the out directory.

- Just by switching my learning style, 4 days worth of work meant nothing because I got the result I wanted in a day.
  I was trying to get things done by purely looking things up in the book, and I immediately notice that there is a 
  spike in the rate of getting things done.

I believe that I got nothing done because I was too reliant on my intuition, and dogmatic thinking that learning
things through book further solidifies understandings.

If I am going to learn things on my own, next time, I should see some kind of demonstration of things work (regarding
the concept I am trying to learng), and then, try to understand the concepts.
