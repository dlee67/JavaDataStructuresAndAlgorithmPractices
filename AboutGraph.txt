(I should be in note that I can use 
queue to perform level ordered traversal 
for trees)

Well, the abstract idea that I am getting for now is

that graph isn't entirely like a tree.



In graph, designation of left and right becomes relatively

miniscual.


Instead, they use concepts called edges.


A Node can have a relationship with the other nodes,

therefore, a graph.


Aside from that, Nodes are no longer called nodes for

convenience sake, they are now called vertices.
