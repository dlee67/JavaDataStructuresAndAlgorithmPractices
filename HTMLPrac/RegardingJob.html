		The first phone interview I've done was not with an HR, it was with an engineer.
		<br><br>
		He asked me something along the line of, "The world of Computer Science is huge; therefore,
		one needs to pick which field they'd like to go into."
		<br><br>
		At one point, I told him I was willing to drop school momentarily, if it meant to be part of the software industry.
		<br><br>
		He told me, "I wouldn't do that."
		<br><br>
		Finally, he told me if I had a project I'd like to show him, and I told him about the text editor
		project I've done on github.
